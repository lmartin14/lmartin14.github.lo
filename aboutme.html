      Hi, I don't think my name actually matters. 
      Fine, if you are desperate enough that your scrolling through this can of garbage, I may as well give you a name. 
      Now, I don't know how to code a name generator so just trust me. 10 minutes later....
       K, I found a random name generator. Do you like Ekene Chidiebube Mackenzie Zan Király, or Iovita Madhu Citlali Chang Luther?
      Well, in any case, I don't care what you think, so I'm going with Ekene Chidiebube Mackenzie Zan Király, okay? Okay. My gender? 
      Would you accept genderqueer? Yes? No? Too bad, cause I don't care. Social life: yeah, I have friends. I bet I have more than you,
      if your still reading this. Need proof? Jeez, you really are pushy, aren't you. My best friend, Wen Tsering Chao Vijaya Ott, is a tiny mouse
      that doesnt like it's name. What did you expect me to name it? Cheez? Aplle? Avisa? Cherioyo? I et your rat's name is Gerald! Ha, I know you have one.
